## Introduction
An introduction to this app is that, it will allow users to
look up football information relating to players they are interested in.

## Description
Developed in Android, Football Info is a search app that will let users search up a player
they are interested in and return the information of that player. Also they will be able
to search for a team. Users can use their Google account to save searches they have looked up.
This will be possible because their account information will be remembered. 

The intended functionality will be a person on their mobile device using a search bar. This will
allow the user to search for the player or team they are interested in. 
My motivation for choosing this as a topic to work on is because it is something I can relate too.
I believe this is a potentially interesting app to users who like football, 
and want general information about their favorite players or teams. 

## Intended Users
Intended for users that may want information about a player
they are interested in looking up. Anyone who is interested in finding out
general information about their favorite players. Also, intended for users that
may want general information about their favorite team. This is intended 
for anyone who has an interest in football.

## Summary of current state of the app

* The current state of the completion of my app so far is that it runs and allows the
user to use Google Sign-In to access the app. Also I have the main-fragment that I will
be using somewhat set up to this point. I need to make sure that the app is able to 
communicate with the information that the user is entering. I still need to populate the
database for the players information. As it is known so far, there are no bugs within my app. 


* I could possible work on the colors if I decide to change them, although I do like the
current color of the app up to this point. I could try to update the font possibly if I can
figure out what to do within my app.



* I might try to create more things that are more fragments if needed within
my project.
 
* I would be able to create more within the database, if I could and also
had the free API resources to do so.

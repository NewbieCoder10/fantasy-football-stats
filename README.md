## Introduction
An introduction to this app is that, it will allow users to
look up football information relating to players they are interested in.

## Description
Developed in Android, Football Info is a search app that will let users search up a player
they are interested in and return the information of that player. Also they will be able
to search for a team. Users can use their Google account to save searches they have looked up.
This will be possible because their account information will be remembered. 

The intended functionality will be a person on their mobile device using a search bar. This will
allow the user to search for the player or team they are interested in. 
My motivation for choosing this as a topic to work on is because it is something I can relate too.
I believe this is a potentially interesting app to users who like football, 
and want general information about their favorite players or teams. 

## Intended Users
Intended for users that may want general information about a player
they are interested in looking up. Anyone who is interested in finding out
general information about their favorite players.
